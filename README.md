### Quick Left - Beerfest Hackfest

Quick Left hosted a beer themed hackathon - Beerfest Hackfest. 

Idea was to create a web application that mapped local breweries using HTML5 geolocation to find your 
location first. Additionally, clicking on a brewery would open a side bar with a list of the beers on tap. 
Unfortunately, could not find that data online so was unable to add that functionality.
