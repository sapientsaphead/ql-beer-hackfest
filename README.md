### Quick Left - Beerfest Hackfest

Quick Left hosted a beer themed hackathon - Beerfest Hackfest. 

Idea was to create a web application that mapped local breweries using HTML5 geolocation to find your 
location first. Additionally, clicking on a brewery would open a side bar with a list of the beers on tap. 
Unfortunately, could not find that data online so was unable to add that functionality.

Geolocation won't work unless you run it on a server. Navigate to the folder in your terminal and run the 
following command:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

It will output the port it is running on - 8000 is the default port: [localhost:8000](localhost:8000)
